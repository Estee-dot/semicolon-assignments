pseudo code: 
stage one:
- Declare the user to calculate of sum (4*10) + (2*4) / 2
- Display the result.

Stage two:
- Declare the user to enter 2  
- store as "firstInteger"

- declare the user to enter 4
- store as "secondInteger"

- Declare the user to enter 10
- store as "thirdInteger"

- Declare the user to enter 4
- store as "fourthInteger"

- multiply firstInteger * fourthInteger
- collect the result
- store as "muiltply2"

- multiply fourthInteger * thirdinteger
- collect the result
- store as "muiltply1"

- divide muiltply1 /2
- store as "divide"

- sum up divide + muiltply2 
- store as "addition"
- Display the result.
