pseudo code: palindrome
Stage one:
- Prompt the user to enter a three digit integer and determine whether it is a palindrome integer.
- Display the result.

Stage Two:
- prompt the user to enter a three digit integer.
- collect the three digit integer.
- Store as "number1"

- separate the first number using "number1" / 100
- collect the result
- store as "digit1" 

- separate the second number using "number1" / 10
- collect the result.
- store as "number2"

- calculate the final second number using "number2" % 10
- collect the result 
- store as "digit2"

- calculate the third digit using "number1" % 10
- collect the result
- store as "digit3"

- if "digit1" == "digit3"
- display "number1" as a palindrome.

- if "digit1" != "digit3"
- display "number1" as non-palindrome
