pseudo code:
Stage one:
- Prompt the user to enter amount of water in kilogram and the initial and final temperature.
- Calculate the energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature.
- Display the result.

stage two:
- Prompt the user to enter amount of water in kilogram
- collect the result 
- store as "Kilogram"

- Prompt the user to enter initial temperature
- collect the result
- store as "initialTemperature"

- Prompt the user to enter final temperature
- collect the result
- store as "finalTemperature"

- calculate the energy needed using "weightOfWaterInKilogram" * ("finalTemperature" - "initialTemperature") * 4184)
- collect the result
- store as "energyNeeded"
- display "energyNeeded"
