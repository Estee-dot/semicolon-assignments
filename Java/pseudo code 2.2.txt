pseudo code: 2.2
Stage one:
- Prompt the user to read the length of the sides of an equilateral triangle, computes the area and volume.
- Display the result.

stage Two:
-prompt the user the enter the length of sides of the triangle.
- collect the result.
- store as "lengthOfSides".

- Calculate the area using area = 1.732/4 * (lengthofSides * lengthOfSides)
- collect the result
- Store as "area"
- Display the result.

- calculate the volume using volume = area * lengthOfSides
- collect the result.
- store as "volume"
- Display the result.
