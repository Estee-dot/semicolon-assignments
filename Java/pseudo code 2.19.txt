pseudo code: 2.19
stage one:
- Prompt the user to enter three points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) of a triangle.

- Display the area.

stage two:
- prompt the user to enter first point.
- collect first point
- store as "x1"

- prompt the user to enter second point.
- collect second point
- store as "y1"

- prompt the user to enter third point.
- collect third point.
- store as "x2"

- prompt the user to enter fourth point.
- collect fourth point.
- store as "y2"

- prompt the user to enter fifth point.
- collect fifth point.
- store as "x3"

- prompt the user to enter sixth point.
- collect sixth point.
- store as "y3"

- calculate the sum of side1 using x1 + y1
- collect the result
- store as "side1"

- calculate the sum of side2 using x2 + y2
- collect the result
- store as "side2"

- calculate the sum of side3 using x3 + y3
- collect the result
- store as "side3"

- calculate s using ("side1" + "side2" + "side3") / 3
- collect the result
- store as "averageSide"

- Calculate the area "averageSide"("averageSide" - side1) * ("averageSide" - side2) * ("averageSide" - side3)
- collect the result
- store as "area"

- calculate the square root of area using Math.sqrt(area) 
- collect the result
- store as "squareRootOfArea"
