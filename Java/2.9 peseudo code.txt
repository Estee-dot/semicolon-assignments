2.9 Pseudo Code
Stage One:
- Prompt the user to enter the starting velocity in meters/second, the ending velocity in meters/second and the time span in seconds.
- Display the average Acceleration.

Stage two:
- Prompt the user to enter the Starting velocity in meters/second.
- Collect velocity in meter/second.
- Store as "starting velocity".

- Prompt the user to enter the ending velocity in meters/second.
- Collect the ending velocity.
- Store as "ending velocity".

- Prompt the user to enter the time span in seconds.
- Collect the time span in seconds.
- Store as "Time span".

- Calculate the Average Acceleration using a = ("ending velocity" - "starting velocity") / "Time span"
- Collect the result.
- Store as "Average acceleration.
- Display "Average acceleration.
