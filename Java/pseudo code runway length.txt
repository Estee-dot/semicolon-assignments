pseudo code: runway length
stage one:
- Prompt the user to enter the velocity in meter/second and the acceleration in meter/second squared.
- calculate the runway length
- Display the minimum runway length.

stage two:
- prompt the user to enter the velocity in meter/second
- collect the result
- store as "velocity"

- prompt the user to enter the acceleration in meter/second squared
- collect the result
- store as "acceleration"

- calculate the runway length using velocity * velocity/ 2 * acceleration
- collect the result
- store as "runwayLength"
